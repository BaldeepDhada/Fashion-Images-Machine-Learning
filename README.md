#Fashion Images Machine Learning Analysis
##By: Baldeep Dhada

- Analyzing fashion images using machine learning techniques such as NMF, PCA, and Regression Trees in R. 
- The raw images produced are compared with the reconstructed images from PCA and NMF. 
- The images are plotted and compared

- The main source of the data can be found at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
- “t10k-images-idx3-ubyte” and “t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte” files from the data folder are analyzed
